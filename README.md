SRA-Dedupe
=================================
This module is part of the [Bond University Centre for Research in Evidence-Based Practice](https://github.com/CREBP) Systematic Review Assistant suite of tools.

This module forms the reference library deduplication tool.

The [previous version of this module](https://github.com/CREBP/SRA/blob/master/application/models/reference.php#L122-L191) was PHP based, this version is NodeJS and is intended to be used as part of a suite - i.e. this module cannot do data access by itself and forms only the most atomic of deduplication operations.
