Many epidemiological studies have shown that post-load hyperglycaemia is a strong and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The few interventional studies available also support a role for postprandial or post-load hyperglycaemia on cardiovascular disease or mortality or on validated surrogates of atherosclerosis. The mechanism through which acute hyperglycaemia could exert its deleterious effects on the vessel wall is very likely multifactorial, but the overproduction of free radicals is probably involved. There is growing evidence that treating postprandial hyperglycaemia should probably be part of the strategies for the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases in pre-diabetes as well as in diabetes. © 2006 Masson, all rights reserved.","address":"(Chiasson) Research Center, CHUM, Hotel-Dieu, 3850 St Urbain Street, Montreal, Que.

Metformin, glitazones, and insulin secretagogues have an additive effect on fasting blood glucose (FBG), and a significant impact on PPG. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors can reduce PPG by a mean 0.50 g/l, no matter what the insulin resistance or insulinopenia status or the other diabetes treatments already in use. After evolving for several years and the failure of oral antidiabetics to normalize fasting blood glucose, long-acting (slow-acting) insulin analogues, well titrated, can reach this goal. They will have no effect on PPG other than a simple level effect. At this stage, rather than overtreating high fasting blood glucose concentrations, systematic PPG exploration should be the rule so as to better define PPG treatment: the advantages of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and the role of GLP-1 analogs should be defined, the use of a rapid-acting insulin analog before the meal causing the highest postprandial blood glucose excursions, even systematically at all three meals, should be considered, or inhaled insulin. As natural life expectancy is on the rise, these active strategies designed to normalize the daily glycemic profile, necessary in a strict strategy to prevent the complications of diabetes, will need to be discussed for an increasing number of patients with type 2 diabetes.

These hemodynamic effects might be more marked in patients with arterial hypertension or metabolic disorders, in particular in hypertensive patients with diabetes. A high-fat load may also induce activation of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. However, the long-term effect of repeated intake of single sugar and fat on blood pressure, oxidative stress, and endothelial function should be tested in controlled trials. On the contrary, a balanced mixed meal (50% carbohydrates) does not induce any significant blood pressure changes. Nevertheless, acarbose treatment is able to reduce hypertension incidence in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and to improve endothelial function. In elderly subjects, in particular with type 2 diabetes or with severe dysautonomia, sigle sugar intake may account for nonhypoglycemic postprandial dizziness.
